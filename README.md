This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

#### In this project I transformed Figma design to responsive design (HTML5,CSS3,JAVASCRIPT) from scratch I used Bootstrap v5.3 to achieve responsive design on all screens And I intergrated that design with Next.JS@latest version project.
