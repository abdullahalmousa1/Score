This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

In this project I transformed Figma design to responsive design (html5,css3,Js) from scratch I used Bootstrap v5.3 to achieve responsive design on all screens and I intergrated that design with Next.JS@latest version project.
